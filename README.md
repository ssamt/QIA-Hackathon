# Instructions
1. Unzip data from phase 1 and 2 as folders on top level.
Name those folders "data" and "data2".
2. Run embed.ipynb
3. Run train.ipynb.
If you wish to see the validation loss/accuracy as well, run with final=False near the top.
Change test_number in the last cell if necessary. It is for naming folders to store tensorboard files and trained models.
4. Run test.ipynb.
Change test_num to 1 or 2 depending on phase.
5. Remember to name the output files carefully, to not overwrite them.
